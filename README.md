### About
`Alex (Pai)` — I and my team research, prototype, and ship ML systems.
- **Nodetree.io**: Tree-structure LLM for parallel queries.
- **Prisma**: Agentic Planning Abstraction Layer, building Workflow-as-Code for repeatable workflow generation.
- **Deepthink in MCTs**: Developing a new way to udpate RL rewards based on Deepthink with Confidence and Monte Carlo Tree Search unsupervised iterations.
- **Language to Langgraph**: automatic LangGraph construction via LLM as finite state machines.
- **T-Few**: transfer learning with few-shot setups for low-label regimes.
- **Raman Spectrum Analysis**: CNN + ordinal classification to detect peaks; separated PAHs vs. pesticides with high accuracy.
- **Low-Light Image Enhancement**: benchmarked DL models for lab imaging. Submitted to **CVPR 2026**

### Brief Work Experience
- **Agentico AI, Inc. (Cofounder & Software Engineer, 2025)** — built a tree-structured LLM multi-agent framework (LangGraph + RAG) for hierarchical context and workflow automation; deployed on AWS and won \$10K in startup awards.
- **American Battery Solutions (Software Engineer Intern, 2025)** — delivered a production code-intelligence and auto-doc portal (libCST + FastAPI) that cut manual documentation by ~85%.
- **ISVision Technology (Software Engineer Intern, 2024)** — implemented an AI-driven code reviewer over GitLab commits (LLaMA + RAG) to automate checks across 100+ CV repos.
- **Computer Vision Center, Barcelona (Research Assistant, 2022–2023)** — co-authored MILL low-light dataset and benchmark; ran SOTA baselines and prepared splits.
