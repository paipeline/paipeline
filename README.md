## 🌱 What I’m Working On
- [**Mindy**](https://mymindy.net): A flashcard generator and storage system based on your notes, enhanced with LLM integration to augment your notes and merge them with external sources such as PDFs, audio, and video links.
- **American Battery Solutions SDE Co-op**: Developing an enterprise-level AI agent for real-time visualization code generation.
- **Screenshots to LLM**: A centralized app for storing screenshots with automatic LLM inference.  
- **NextAPI**: Chat with my bot to learn more about the research initiative.  
- **AWS Certifications**: Preparing for both **Solutions Architect Associate** and **Machine Learning Specialty** to build AI-integrated cloud systems.
- **Writing HPC with C++**: Creating public notes on developing high-throughput, CUDA & parallel systems by referencing my progress in CS557 taught by Prof. Eftychios Sifakis - (scientist at NVIDIA), and resources from NVIDIA.

## 🏋️ Hobbies
- Coding at the gym, of course!
