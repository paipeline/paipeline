### About
`Alex (Pai)` — I and my team research, prototype, and ship ML systems.
- **Nodetree.io**: Tree-structure LLM for parallel queries.
- **Prisma**: Agentic Planning Abstraction Layer, building Workflow-as-Code for repeatable workflow generation.
- **Deepthink in MCTs**: Developing a new way to udpate RL rewards based on Deepthink with Confidence and Monte Carlo Tree Search unsupervised iterations.
- **Language to Langgraph**: automatic LangGraph construction via LLM as finite state machines.
- **T-Few**: transfer learning with few-shot setups for low-label regimes.
- **Raman Spectrum Analysis**: CNN + ordinal classification to detect peaks; separated PAHs vs. pesticides with high accuracy.
- **Low-Light Image Enhancement**: benchmarked DL models for lab imaging. Submitted to **CVPR 2026**
