# 👋 Hi there, I’m Pai (Alex)

👨‍💻 Double major in Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; transferred from B.S. in AI at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, with 4 years of continuous ML research experience.
- **T-Few**: Engaged in the study and application of transfer learning techniques using few-shot learning, focusing on tasks that benefit from minimal labeled data.
- **Raman Spectrum Analysis**: Developed ML models using CNNs and ordinal classification to detect Raman spectrum peaks, achieving high accuracy in separating PAHs and pesticides for chemical identification.
- **Low-Light Image Enhancement**: Benchmarked deep learning models to improve image quality in low-light laboratory conditions.

🌟 Passionate about building scalable ML integrated systems.

## 🌱 What I’m Working On
- [**Mindy**](https://mymindy.net): A flashcard generator and storage system based on your notes, enhanced with LLM integration to augment your notes and merge them with external sources such as PDFs, audio, and video links.
- **American Battery Solutions SDE Co-op**: Developing an enterprise-level AI agent for real-time C code topological graph and documentation generation code generation by RAG and the analysis of AST.
- **NodeTree.io**：System that dissects problem into manageable subproblems and addresses each one with help of Multimodal AI, delivering clear, step-by-step problem solutions with branches of subproblem nodes.
- **Writing HPC with C++**: Creating public notes on developing high-throughput, CUDA & parallel systems by referencing my progress in CS557 taught by Prof. Eftychios Sifakis - (scientist at NVIDIA), and resources on HPC/Scientifc Computing from NVIDIA.Developer.

## AWS Certifications
- Got AWS Solutions Architect Associate.
- Now preparing for **Machine Learning Specialty** to build scalable AI-integrated cloud systems.
