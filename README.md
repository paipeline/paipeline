### About
`Alex (Pai)` — I research, prototype, and ship ML systems that survive the jump from paper → product.

- UPLAW: Agentic Planning Abstraction Layer
- FSM-based **Agent Builder**: automatic LangGraph construction via LLM + finite state machines.
- **T-Few**: transfer learning with few-shot setups for low-label regimes.
- **Raman Spectrum Analysis**: CNN + ordinal classification to detect peaks; separated PAHs vs. pesticides with high accuracy.
- **Low-Light Image Enhancement**: benchmarked DL models for lab imaging.

### AWS
- ✅ **Solutions Architect – Associate**
- 🎯 Preparing **Machine Learning – Specialty** (cloud-native, scalable AI pipelines)

---

### Projects (in the wild / RIP)
- **MyMindy** — _Data Mining Your Notes_: AI/NLP to extract & surface actionable insights from personal notes. → https://www.Mymindy.net
- **Step.ai** — AI↔AI networking (coffee chats for agents; autonomous resume exchange & interaction)
- **Vitaelia** — AI Vision Necklaces (burned an Arduino 🔥)

---

### Tech Stack
`Python` · `PyTorch` · `LangGraph` · `LangChain` · `FastAPI` · `AWS (S3, Lambda, ECS, Step Functions)` · `Docker` · `CUDA`  
`CV/Signal` (CNNs, enhancement, spectral analysis) · `NLP` (few-shot/transfer, agents)

---

### Hobbies
- Researching new ideas & recombining them for real-world problems  
- Language exchange (ES/中文) — sometimes on **free4talk**  
- Biking, hiking, tennis; a veces un poco de fútbol tmb
